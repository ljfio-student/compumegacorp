The ultimate work simulator. Your mission as poor soul number 10001 in CompuMegaCorp's employee database, is to work work work.
Your role is to join task forces to ensure the completion of jobs are done so promptly!
However, there is a chance that one of the job's tasks fail to complete, leaving a member of the team having to take the blame.

The choice is yours, on whether to take the blame yourself or to point the finger at one of your peers.
Based on how well you corroborate your stories, the CEO will take note of the incompetent and demote them down the career ladder.
If you're able to blag your way out of the task failing, the CEO will promote your efforts in keeping the team afloat.

## Future Additions

Look to add variable weighting to the score system when score is to be deducted.
Making it more dangerous to get the blame higher up the management ladder.

It would have been good to edit the list of available tasks within the system from an admin user interface.
Potentially disabling user accounts from an admin interface as well.

Users to have the ability to change their username, email or password.
